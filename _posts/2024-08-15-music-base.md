As both an important addendum to [my previous article]( {{ site.url }}/posts/music-domain-expansion/ ) and as a great preparation for the unless stream of <span class="emph">"what's your major/mother's maiden name/social insurance number/music taste"</span>-esque questions that I'll unfortunately have to answer non-stop less than two weeks from now, I thought it would be nothing but productive to get the jump on creating a comprehensive list of what actually defines my personal music taste.

The following listing is not an exhaustive list by any means, and I'll certainly go into more detail about each in due time. Just understand that if it is on this list, I quite like it.

Furthermore, I'll categorize them into the different subsets of how I percieve the vibe from each artist.

## (Potentially) Male Manipulator Teenage Bands

### Radiohead

My favorite Radiohead albums/songs are:

- OK COMPUTER OKNOTOK
    - Paranoid Android
    - Subterranean Homesick Alien
    - Electioneering
    - Karma Police
    - Man of War
    - The Tourist
- In Rainbows
    - 15 Step
    - Weird Fishes/Arpeggi
    - Jigsaw Falling into Place
- Kid A
    - Everything in its Right Place
    - Idioteque
- Amnesiac
    - Pulk/Pull (True Love Waits Version)
    - Knives Out
    - Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box
- The Bends
    - The Bends
    - Just

Radiohead is fairly difficult to rank effectively for me, but I genuinely believe that they are my second favorite band of all time. I'm unoriginal (and, to be perfectly honest, I don't even try to be original), so <span class="emph">"OK Computer OKNOTOK"</span> has almost entirely changed my life for the better, especially the song <span class="emph">Paranoid Android</span>.

## The "Look at me! I'm so sophisticated for liking this!"

### Piero Piccioni

Piccioni is hands-down my favorite composer by far, and seeing the way his music works with any piece of visual media has completely changed the sense of unity and composition that I look for in music.

### ..but.. what about Classical Music?

I *could* list some classical composers (cool ones that come immediately to mind are Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, and Chopin), but to be honest, I kind of just listen to whatever I currently have on hand. I'm really not that precise with my musical aptitude that I can even honestly distinguish between Liszt and Mozart or Beethoven and Bach or so on and so forth. I just like it all a bit, I suppose.

## High Testosterone Music for High Testosterone Men

This is far less of a categorical breakdown of music by different artists, but rather, an unorganized list of various songs fit only for people of verifiably high masculinity, as they are, certainly, incredibly masculine.
