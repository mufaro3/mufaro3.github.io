I am quite proud of how awful my music taste is. In the first place, I don't particularly have a complete sense of what kind of music I *actually* like, and all of my playlists are quite a bit closer to being ragtag collections of various songs that I've simply crossed paths with over time rather than being well-refined sets of tunes designed to fit a specific mood or purpose at any given point in time. I've once joked that my music taste will have a song like <span class="emph">"Paranoid Android" by Radiohead</span> (which, *FYI*, is my favorite song of all time) followed shortly after by something like <span class="emph">Die Very Rough by Mario Judah</span> <span class="unemph small">(gay parody)</span>.

This is not to say that my music taste was empty, however. You can get a fairly good idea of what I was listening to before over on my other [article]({{ site.url }}/posts/music-base/). 

### HOWEVER, MY FRIENDS! THIS MUSICAL INDECISION SHALL CONTINUE NO LONGER! I SWEAR UPON IT!

In order to understand my present situation, let's first go back a bit to the past. Roughly two or so months ago, I bought my first ever records at a store out in Spring, Texas for next to nothing on a complete whim, and after listening to them for the first time, I was absolutely hooked. Less than two weeks later, I had my own record player, an admittedly pretty dogshit little Amazon turntable that I used to cause all-out auditory havoc with in my house. Most of my records were dollar-store thrift picks of music originating from anywhere between the later half of the 1800s to, at earliest, about 1970, so my music taste was heavily antiquated compared to type of music I had been listening to previously.

Now, we skip to present day. I've actually garnered something resembling a music taste, but by god, it's sort of all over the place. With no real playlists other than one gigantic megamix of every song I've ever even taking a slight amount of interest in, it is undoubtedly more than a bit late to finally explore some new artists and develop some real playlists.

## This Cannot Continue: Moving Forward

Moving forward, I've actually got a bit of a plan as to how I'll work to diversify my music taste a bit. I'm slowly taking suggestions on the kind of music that I listen to, but it's undeniably difficult to really feel sold on new music for the first couple of listens.

For a picture of what I've been trying to listen to, here's a list of some of them alongside my thoughts surrounding each band/song/album/etc.:

- Aurora Avenue
- Lamp
- Tom Odell
- Gang of Youths
- Sufjan Stevens
- King Crimson

I'll post reviews for everything eventually! Feel free to send me more!
