Welcome to <span class="highlight mono small">{{ site.title }}</span>. My name is Mufaro, but I go online by a variety of handles: <span class="anti-highlight mono small">{ <span class="string small">"nickelulz"</span>, <span class="string small">"nickelulzywulzy"</span>, <span class="string small">"wulzy"</span>, <span class="string small">"μ"</span>, <span class="string small">"mμfaro"</span>, <span class="string small">"moofy"</span>, <span class="string small">"nickelelelelelel"</span>, <span class="string small">"nicklesidk"</span>, <span class="normal">and <span class="italic">sometimes</span></span>, <span class="string small">"Anna Karenina"</span> }.</span>

I'm currently an undergrad at <span class="highlight">The University of British Columbia</span> in <span class="highlight">Vancouver, BC, Canada</span>, and I have a variety of interests, so I decided to set up this web page to chronicle all of them.

I'm studying to become a researcher in Computer Science! Check out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}cv">/cv/</a> to check my progress on getting there! I love low-level and functional programming, but I'm not too afraid of higher level work (this site being evidence of that).

If you like what you see here, feel free to leave a message on my guestbook on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}gb">/gb/</a>. If there's something a bit more private or serious you would like to contact me about, leave an email!

And lastly, if you know me in real life and we went to high school together, turn around immediately and forget this page exists. <span class="highlight italic">I did not exist before graduation.</span>
