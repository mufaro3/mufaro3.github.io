My name is Mufaro, but I go online by a variety of handles, largely <span class="unemph mono small">{ <span class="string small">"nickelulz"</span>, <span class="string small">"moofy"</span>, and <span class="string small">"nickel"</span> }.</span> You might also recognize me by the 'mu' that I use fairly often as well (as its the first two letters of my name).

This website is pretty heavily inspired by a number of other people's work. I took the menu system and overall vibe from [lainchan.org](https://lainchan.org) and mixed it with the functional style closer to [tom7.org](http://tom7.org). As for the exact theme, this site is using the static site generator Jekyll with a heavily-modified version of the [Clyell theme](https://github.com/gildasio/clyell) by gildasio.

This website is hosted via github pages, a services I am much thankful for, and I edit each of these pages largely as a creole version of Markdown mixed with HTML on GNU Emacs, my editor of choice, and is broken up into four main blog sections or <span class="emph">boards</span>, that being 
- [/λ/]({{ site.url }}/λ), the programming/physics/mathematics/STEM board (where I post about projects I'm working on, classes I'm taking, or other things within the topic that interest me),
- [/per/]({{ site.url }}/per), the personal board (where I post about myself and whatever doesn't fit on the other boards),
- [/med/]({{ site.url }}/med), the media board (where I post about media like books, music, tv shows, and the like), and lastly, 
- [/vg/]({{ site.url }}/vg), the videogames board (where I post about videogames I like, which are usually fairly old).
- [/es/]({{ site.url }}/es), the essay board (where I write long ranting posts about some topic or other that's been bugging me, like politics or economics or something something society).

Additionally, you may notice that there are a few quotes or cliches dotted about the place. The website is setup such that it randomly picks certain phrases from a bank in some areas, such as the leading message-of-the-day (or MOTD) at the top of the page, which (as of writing this) is set to shuffle between the three core chants in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: "WAR IS PEACE," "IGORANCE IS STRENGTH," and "FREEDOM IS SLAVERY." Similarly, the footer is set to cycle in the same manner between 

1. "Forever in debt to your priceless advice," a quote from *Heart-Shaped Box* by Nirvana, 
2. "That's it sir? You're leaving?" from *Paranoid Android* by Radiohead, 
3. "Please excuse me from gym, I have a terrible cold coming on" from *The Headmaster Ritual* by The Smiths, and 
4. "Close the world, open the next" from *Serial Experiments Lain*. 

On each recompile of the website (which results upon every update), these change entirely at random. 

It's quite a bit of fun to sit down and write these articles. I suggest that everyone should have a blog, honestly. The beauty of the internet, in my opinion, is that you can cast out into the void whatever thoughts you think are relevant enough to share, and with so little as an email, the void can respond.
