My name is Mufaro, but I go online by a variety of handles, largely <span class="unemph mono small">{ <span class="string small">"nickelulz"</span>, <span class="string small">"moofy"</span>, and <span class="string small">"nickel"</span> }.</span>

This website is pretty heavily inspired by a number of other people's work. I took the menu system and overall vibe from [lainchan.org](https://lainchan.org) and mixed it with the functional style closer to [tom7.org](http://tom7.org). As for the exact theme, this site is using the static site generator Jekyll with a heavily-modified version of the [Clyell theme](https://github.com/gildasio/clyell) by gildasio.

I literally did not know what to write, so I just tacked on an interesting image.
