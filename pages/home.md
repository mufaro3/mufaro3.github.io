Welcome to <span class="highlight mono small">{{ site.title }}</span>. My name is Mufaro, but I go online by a variety of handles: <span class="anti-highlight mono small">{ <span class="string small">"nickelulz"</span>, <span class="string small">"nickelulzywulzy"</span>, <span class="string small">"wulzy"</span>, <span class="string small">"μ"</span>, <span class="string small">"mμfaro"</span>, <span class="string small">"moofy"</span>, <span class="string small">"nickelelelelelel"</span>, <span class="string small">"nickel"</span>, <span class="normal">and <span class="italic">sometimes</span></span>, <span class="string small">"Anna Karenina"</span> }.</span>

I'm currently an undergrad at <span class="highlight">The University of British Columbia</span> in <span class="highlight">Vancouver, BC, Canada</span>, and I have a variety of interests, so I decided to set up this web page to chronicle all of them.

I'm studying to become a researcher in Computer Science! Check out <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}cv">/cv/</a> to check my progress on getting there! I love low-level and functional programming, but I'm not too afraid of higher level work (this site being evidence of that). 

I would *probably* kill a man for a research grant, and I want a <span class="highlight">PhD in Computer Science</span> more than unlimited cigarettes and beer (which I would **certainly** love), so I'm always open to discuss scientific computing/technology/academia in general over on [/λ/]({{ site.url }}/λ).

In my free time, I love all kinds of videogames, music, literature, and film, and I especially love to complain or gush about all of the aforementioned. Take a peek over at [/med/]({{ site.url}}/med) and [/vg/]({{ site.url }}/vg) to view such irrelevant ramblings, or alternatively, peek at [/per/]({{ site.url }}/per) to read all of the posts I make that just don't seem to fit anywhere else on this site. 

If you like what you see here, feel free to leave a message on my guestbook on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}gb">/gb/</a>. If there's something a bit more private or serious you would like to contact me about, leave an [email](mailto:nickelulz@proton.me)!

This website is pretty heavily inspired by a number of other people's work, as I'm not very original and simply prefer to steal ideas/content from other people. I took the menu system and overall vibe from [lainchan.org](https://lainchan.org) and mixed it with the functional style closer to [tom7.org](http://tom7.org).
