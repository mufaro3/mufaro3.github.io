description: "\"Package won't work? Install Gentoo. Programming bug? Install Gentoo. Wife left you? Install Gentoo. Lost your kids? Install Gentoo.\" <br> <br> This board is always the pinnacle of technological seriousness, much like this website. Trust me: you won't regret following all of my advice like it came from Richard Stallman himself, because as they always say: <span class=\"italic\">\"You can totally trust the programming advice of a random undergrad's shitty blog!\"</span>"
